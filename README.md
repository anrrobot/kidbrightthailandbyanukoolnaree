## Overview

The theme of this project is a cultural performance of the E-san people in the 
Northeast region of Thailand that shows happiness and joy through an upbeat non-lyrical music. The performance demonstrates the fun-loving personality of E-San culture. Musical instruments in the project are made from local materials and all have their origins from E-san tradition, such as, 
* Pong Lang: a percussion instrument, which  is inspired by wooden cow bell . The logs of different lengths are arranged to form musical notes.
* Phin:  a type of musical instrument that is similar to a guitar, has only 3 strings.
* Khaen: a wind instrument made from bamboo.

These musical instruments are usually accompanied by hythmic instruments (such as drums) and traditional dance expressing hopefulness and joy.
