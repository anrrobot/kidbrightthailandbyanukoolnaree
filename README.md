## Overview

The theme of this project is a cultural performance of the E-san people in the 
Northeast region of Thailand that shows happiness and joy through an upbeat non-lyrical music. The performance demonstrates the fun-loving personality of E-San culture. Musical instruments in the project are made from local materials and all have their origins from E-san tradition, such as, 
* Pong Lang: a percussion instrument, which  is inspired by wooden cow bell . The logs of different lengths are arranged to form musical notes.
* Phin:  a type of musical instrument that is similar to a guitar, has only 3 strings.
* Khaen: a wind instrument made from bamboo.

These musical instruments are usually accompanied by hythmic instruments (such as drums) and traditional dance expressing hopefulness and joy.

In the performance, there are 6 robots presented, consisting of 4 musicians, 1 dancer, and 1 conductor.
* Musician No.1 plays Pong Lang.
* Musician No.2 plays Phin.
* Musician No.3 plays Khaen.
* Musician No.4 plays drum.

The robot musicians and the robot dancers are controlled by the robot conductor, with an AI model developed using KibBright AI platform. The robot conductor will recognize the three different objects (Kratip Khao, Sai, wicker basket) human dancer who dances along with the robots use in her dance and will send infrared control signals to all other robots to change choreographs accordingly.

## Features: 
* The robot performance is using image classification by KidBright AI Platform. The human performer will show one by one of the 3 local equipment in front of the camera. Then, the KidBright AI Platform will classify the image and send a signal via Bluetooth to the conductor robot. Next, the conductor robot will send an infrared signal to the dancer robot to perform dance movements that correspond with the classified image.


* The dancer’s arm imitates the mobility of the human arm with the coordination of four 180-degree servos that make the dancer robot’s dance similar to human’s dance and more beautiful.


* The communication between the robots while they are performing uses wireless communication via Bluetooth and infrared signals.


* The dancer robot can move omnidirectionally. It can also prevent collisions by using ultrasonic sensors and will stop moving when an object is detected at a predetermined distance from the robot.
